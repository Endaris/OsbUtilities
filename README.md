# How to use
The project is mostly designed to work as a library.

The OsbConsoleInterpreter is a minimal application that demonstrates the intended use.

You can test it by providing a path to a mapset that contains a storyboard in .osb format, for example:
```
OsbConsoleInterpreter.exe "C:\Program Files\osu!\Songs\104621 Rhythmics & Cat Like Thief - Summer Wars"
```
