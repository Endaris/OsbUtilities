This project's goal is to provide an assistance in identifying potential issues in regards to the rankability and performance of osu! storyboards.

Please make sure you understand the limitations and implications of information generated by this project and always confirm issues yourself if you intend to use it for modding purposes.

# How to use
The project is mostly designed to work as a library.

The OsbConsoleInterpreter is a minimal application that demonstrates the intended use.

You can test it by providing a path to a mapset that contains a storyboard in .osb format, for example:
```
OsbConsoleInterpreter.exe "C:\Program Files\osu!\Songs\104621 Rhythmics & Cat Like Thief - Summer Wars"
```
Note that this may take a while as a lot of data is generated and evaluated to generate the warnings and draw the graphs.

When the evaluation is done you will find 3 files, SBEvaluation.txt, commandgraph.jpg and spritegraph.jpg in the mapset folder.

Check the wiki for further information on how to work with these.
